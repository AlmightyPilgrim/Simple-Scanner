	-Time estimate vs Actual

## Description
 This project allows for a list of up to 50 tasks to be shown. Using the simple scanner method of
task management. This list can be updated by anyone, adding more tasks to be done, deleteing ones
that do not need to be viewed anymore, marking for completion or having been worked on, and viewing
the current 50 available into 2 different pages. If the user goes over 50 tasks, it does not show
all the tasks to avoid overwhelming the user.

## Task Management
 Instead of using the Kanban board, I decided to use the issues feature of github to track what I needed
to get done. This was a good method for me as it gave me a list of what needed to be done, allowing me to
progress continually instead of wondering what was needed to get done next.

The estimated times are in the list above.
Acutal times:

	-Input tasks - 30 min
	-Choose task via simple scanning - 60 min
	-Re-enter or cross off - 60 min
	-Console Interface - 60 min
	-Save in File (hard-coded name) - 100 min
	-Full page (25 lines), crossed out items in grey - 60 min
	-First page starts w/ first uncompleted task - 60 min
	-Select task, next page, add task, or delete - 90-120 min 
											menu - 30 min		(This one was more of a combination of all
																the other issues, though the menu system
																did not take as long.)
